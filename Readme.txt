Morphognosis learning and control of Mox.

A mox is an organism occupying a cell in a cellular automaton. A mox has an orientation
and can sense landmarks in front of it. It also has a sense for the proximity of food.
A mox is capable of moving forward, turning, and consuming food.
A primary purpose of the project is investigate morphognosis learning and control of the mox.

Setup:

1. Unzip the moxworx.zip file.
2. Import Eclipse project.
3. Run .sh or .bat commands in the work directory.

Morphognosis: the shape of knowledge in space and time

Abstract
Artificial intelligence research to a great degree focuses on the brain and behaviors that the brain generates. 
But the brain, an extremely complex structure resulting from millions of years of evolution, can be viewed as 
a solution to problems posed by an environment existing in space and time. The environment generates signals 
that produce sensory events within an organism. Building an internal spatial and temporal model of the environment 
allows an organism to navigate and manipulate the environment. In keeping with nature's penchant for extending 
rather than replacing, the purpose mammalian neocortex might then be to soak up signals from distant reaches of 
space and time and render them, as though yet near and present, to the older, deeper brain whose instinctual roles 
have little changed over eons. Here this notion is embodied in a model called morphognosis (morpho = shape and 
gnosis = knowledge). Its basic structure is a pyramid of event recordings called a morphognostic. At the apex of 
the pyramid are the most recent and nearby event recordings. Receding from the apex are recordings of less recent 
and possibly more distant events. A morphognostic can thus be viewed as a structure of progressively larger chunks 
of space-time knowledge. Pattern matching a current morphognostic with an internal set of morphognostics allows a 
response to be selected that serves some purpose to the organism. The set of morphognostics forms a long-term memory 
that can be learned by exposure to the environment. A cellular automaton is used as the platform to investigate the 
morphognosis model, using a simulated organism that learns and navigates its world in search of food.
